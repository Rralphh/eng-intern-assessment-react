# Stopwatch Functionality Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation and usage of the stopwatch functionality in the React application. The stopwatch component allows users to start, stop, reset, and record laps with real-time updates.

## Components

The stopwatch functionality is divided into three main components:

1. **App**: The main component that renders the stopwatch and handles its core functionality.
2. **Stopwatch**: A display component that shows the current time of the stopwatch.
3. **StopwatchButton**: A component that contains buttons for controlling the stopwatch (start, stop, reset, and lap).

## Features

- **Start/Stop**: Users can start and stop the stopwatch timer.
- **Reset**: Users can reset the stopwatch to zero.
- **Lap Recording**: Users can record the current time as a lap, which is displayed below the stopwatch.
- **Real-Time Update**: The stopwatch updates in real-time, displaying minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
